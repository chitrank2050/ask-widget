# Theming

**ask-widget** comes with a premium, monochrome design based on the "zinc" and "neutral" color palettes popular in the modern developer ecosystem.

## Built-in Themes

You can toggle between `dark` and `light` themes with the `theme` prop:

```tsx
<ChatWidget theme="light" />
```

## Custom Colors

If you need to align the widget's colors with your personal site, you can pass a `colors` object:

```tsx
<ChatWidget
  colors={{
    primary: "#f43f5e",    /* Accent color for bubbles and buttons */
    background: "#09090b", /* Background color of the chat panel */
    text: "#fafafa",       /* Main text color */
    border: "#27272a",     /* Border colors for the widget */
    userBubble: "#18181b", /* Background of user messages */
    surface: "#111113",    /* Background of input and system chips */
  }}
/>
```

### Note on Custom Colors:
These values are applied as CSS variables to ensure they are consistent across the UI. They will override the theme defaults for both `dark` and `light` presets.
